# ASRdys

### Description
ASRdys is a Kaldi recipe to build an ASR for speakers with dysarthria. The recipe works on the Torgo database [1] so you need to obtain this data first and include its location into the path.sh file.
Several models are used in the pipeline implemented in run.sh/runMultipleSubtests.sh.

### Usage

To train several models on all the speakers except one for testing do:
```sh
  bash ./run.sh <test_speaker>
```
where \<test_speaker\> is one of the 15 speakers in the database.

To train several models on 15 different configurations taking a different test speaker at a time do:
```sh
  bash ./runAllTests.sh
```

To train several models and see the results in different partions of the test set define those partitions with torgo_data_prep_multiple_tests.sh (if different to the current ones), initialise the *tests* variable in runMultipleSubtests.sh and do as before:
```sh
  bash ./runMultipleSubtests.sh <test_speaker>
```

Remember to adapt path.sh to your necessities.

#### TODO
Update the Deep Learning scripts  
Add a RESULTS file
